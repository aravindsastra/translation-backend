Language Translation Web Application - Assignment


Objective:

Develop an application that translates text from one language to another with a simple and clean UI. Use any library for translation. Provide insights on deploying the app at scale, with monitoring and testing strategies.


Key Features:

        1.        Text Translation:

        •        Translate text from a source language to a target language.

        2.        Language Detection:

        •        Automatically identify the source language.

        3.        Speech Integration:

        •        Convert spoken words to text and translate.

        4.        Audio Playback:

        •        Use text-to-speech to play translated text.


Assignment Scope:

The application needs to expose the following functionalities:

        1.        Setup

        •        Functionality: Initialize translation libraries and APIs. Set up speech-to-text and text-to-speech engines.

        •        Parameters:

        •        Translation library configuration.

        •        API keys for translation, STT, and TTS services.

        2.        Translation Method

        •        Functionality: Translate text or audio inputs to a specified language.

        •        Parameters:

        •        Input text or audio.

        •        Target language for translation.

        •        Operations:

        •        Detect source language if unspecified.

        •        Translate text using the chosen library.

        •        Convert translated text to speech if needed.

        3.        User Interface:

        •        Design a simple UI for text input, language selection, and translation output.

        •        Integrate speech features into the UI for input and output.

        4.        Concurrency and Efficiency:

        •        Handle multiple translation requests simultaneously.

        •        Optimize response times for translation and audio processing.

        5.        Observability:

        •        Monitor translation performance and error rates.

        •        Log request times and success rates.


Nice to Have:

        •        Speech-to-text integration for spoken inputs.

        •        Text-to-speech output for translations.

        •        Language detection without user input.



Deliverables:

        •        Source code hosted on GitHub.

        •        Demo application with a functional UI.

        •        README file with setup and usage instructions.

        •        Documentation outlining assumptions, deployment, and testing strategies.


Instructions:

        •        Prioritize code quality and best practices.

        •        Document any assumptions made.

        •        Focus on robust error handling and clean code.

        •        Feel free to ask questions for clarification.
